                    <h3>Introduction to Web development</h3>

                    <p class="post 1">Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web
                        applications that run on the internet. It involves a combination of programming, design, and
                        problem-solving to create interactive and visually appealing experiences for users. Web
                        development can be broadly divided into front-end, which deals with the part of the website
                        users see and interact with, and back-end, which manages the server, database, and application
                        logic behind the scenes.

                        Front-end development uses languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure content, style
                        layouts, and add interactivity. Back-end development involves server-side languages such as PHP,
                        Python, Ruby, or Node.js, and databases like MySQL or MongoDB to store and manage data.
                        Full-stack developers handle both front-end and back-end tasks.

                        The field of web development is constantly evolving with new frameworks, libraries, and tools
                        that enhance efficiency, security, and user experience. Popular frameworks include React,
                        Angular, and Vue for front-end, and Express, Django, and Laravel for back-end. Overall, web
                        development is a crucial and dynamic skill set in today’s digital world, enabling businesses and
                        individuals to connect, share, and grow online effectively.

                    <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
                    <p class="post 2"> 

                        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and design
                        webpages. HTML structures the content of a website by using various tags and elements. These
                        tags define headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables, forms, and other content types
                        on a webpage. For example,h1 defines a heading, p defines a paragraph, and a defines a hyperlink.

                        HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language, meaning it structures and
                        organizes data rather than performing logical operations. It works alongside CSS
                        (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. HTML5,
                        the latest version, introduced powerful features like audio, video, canvas, and semantic
                        tags such as header, footer, and section, improving accessibility and readability of code.

                        All browsers understand HTML, making it the backbone of web development.
                        Learning HTML is the first step for anyone interested in creating websites
                        or web applications, as it provides the foundation to build visually
                        appealing and well-structured web pages effectively</p>

                    <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
                    <p class="post 3">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful stylesheet language used to control the
                        presentation, layout, and design of HTML documents. While HTML structures web content, CSS
                        enhances its appearance, allowing developers to create visually attractive and user-friendly
                        websites. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styling rules such as colors, fonts,
                        spacing, alignment, and positioning. It uses selectors to target elements and properties to
                        define their styles.

                        One key feature of CSS is separation of content from presentation, making websites easier to
                        maintain and update. It also allows for reusability, as the same stylesheet can style multiple
                        pages consistently. CSS supports responsive design techniques using media queries, ensuring
                        websites look good on all devices, from mobiles to desktops.

                        The "cascading" nature of CSS refers to how styles are applied based on specificity and source
                        order, allowing developers to override styles strategically. Over time, CSS has evolved with
                        features like Flexbox and Grid for complex layouts, animations for interactive designs, and
                        variables for maintainable code. Overall, CSS is essential for creating modern, professional,
                        and engaging web experiences. </p>

                    <h3>Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
                    <p class="post 4"> 

                        JavaScript is a powerful, high-level programming language widely used for creating interactive
                        and dynamic web pages. It was initially developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape Navigator
                        to add small client-side scripts that could interact with the user and enhance webpages beyond
                        static HTML and CSS. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved into a robust, versatile language
                        used not just in browsers but also on servers through environments like Node.js.

                        JavaScript follows the ECMAScript standard and is known for its lightweight nature, interpreted
                        execution, and event-driven, asynchronous programming capabilities. It allows developers to
                        manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle user events, validate forms, create
                        animations, and build interactive user interfaces. Modern JavaScript also supports
                        Object-Oriented and Functional programming paradigms, enhancing code reusability and
                        maintainability.

                        With the rise of frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue, JavaScript has become
                        essential for front-end development. Additionally, its usage in backend, mobile apps, and even
                        machine learning shows its immense versatility, making it one of the most popular programming
                        languages in the world today.</p>
